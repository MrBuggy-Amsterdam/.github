# Welcome to the MrBuggy organization üèéÔ∏è

This is the home of (most of) the code, protocols and utilities we have used and are still using in the NXP cup EMEA, the autonomous car racing competition in which we are contending for the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Most of our code so far is written in Go and Python3, and we are currently in the process of porting everything to Go because it is nice and fast. We also previously worked from a monorepo setup but are mgirating to an organization multi-repo setup.
